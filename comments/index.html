1.  The entire proposed project lies within the Catskill Forest
      Preserve, which has been protected in the New York State
      Constitution since 1894.

2.  The proposed project would violate the designation of the Catskill
      Forest Preserve as Status 1 land by the Federal government, a
      protection which explicitly bars development

3.  The project would severely impact traffic on New York State Route
      214, wreaking economic havoc on the affected hamlets, towns, and
      counties.

4.  Key players were not notified beforehand, as legally required.

5.  The topography of the land would make rerouting or replacing New
      York State Route 214 impossible,

6.  New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection operates the
      city’s drinking water supply under a Filtration Avoidance
      Determination (FAD) issued by the US Environmental Protection
      Administration.

7.  As proposed, PEH’s project is not a closed loop system

8.  With so much private property located within close proximity to the
      Stony Clove creek, and surrounded by the Catskill Forest Preserve,
      relocation of homes and businesses along the creek is impossible
      without amendment of the New York State Constitution.

We believe PEH’s proposal is filled with erroneous and misleading

On behalf of Northern Catskills Audubon Society, the 350-member chapter
of the National Audubon Society, and whose chapter territory includes
the area of this proposal, I offer these comments in opposition to the
proposed Ashokan Pumped Energy Storage Project, Docket P-15056.

The proposed project is located within the Catskill Peaks Important Bird
Area (IBA), identified by Audubon New York as one of the largest
contiguous forest tracts in the state. The area was given IBA
designation due to the presence of high-elevation breeding bird species,
such as Bicknell’s Thrush and Blackpoll Warbler, as well as home to the
suite of lower-elevation forest nesting birds. Many of these are
considered species of Special Concern or Threatened in New York State,
or Species of Greatest Conservation Need and include American Black
Duck, Osprey, Bald Eagle, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper’s Hawk, Northern
Goshawk, Red-shouldered Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, American Woodcock,
Olive-sided Flycatcher, Wood Thrush, Scarlet Tanager, Cerulean Warbler,
Black-throated Blue Warbler, and Canada Warbler. In addition to state
protections, Bald Eagle is afforded federal protection under the Bald
and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Ashokan Reservoir, as part of the
IBA, is an important site for wintering waterfowl and it is unknown how
water depth fluctuations from this project would affect those birds.

Permanent protection of this IBA is of utmost importance to protecting
the aforementioned species. This project, if approved, would fragment
the forest to the detriment of those species, as well as species
currently not identified as in need of protections.

We urge FERC to stop this project before much time and money are
needlessly spent, given that further, detailed negative environmental
effects that will certainly be identified in an EIS if the project is
approved to move to the next step.

Sincerely,

Larry Federman

RE: MOTION TO INTERVENE ON PROJECT # 15056-000, ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE
PROJECT

Dear FERC,

I am filing a motion to intervene for proposed project #15056, Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project. I co-own 9.1 acres of property at 624 Woodland
Valley Rd (24.8.1.11), and am a member of Woodland Valley Woods, LLC, 20
acres in size, and Woodland Valley Farm, LLC, approximately 105 acres in
size, which would be inundated by the proposed reservoir in Woodland
Valley associated with the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Our family has owned and lived on this property since 1835, making me a
seventh-generation owner of land that would have to be taken away by
imminent domain to be buried forever under water. The property includes
a homestead constructed in 1865 following the conclusion of the Civil
War and an original barn built in that era. We have a gravesite on the
property, and numerous family heirlooms from generations of family who
were born on, who served the military during the Civil War, the First
World War and World War II, who worked, and who died on this property.
Our family has invested significant time in collaboration with NYC DEP
to serve as good stewards of the property in its important role in
contributing clean drinking water downstream to New York residents,
including the sale of a 97-acre conservation easement to NYC DEP in 2014
that sacrificed our right to further subdivide and develop much of the
property in perpetuity to help ensure watershed protection. We adopted a
Forest Management Stewardship plan through NYC DEP in 2014 and entered
the Woodland Valley Woods, LLC property into the National Tree Farm
System to ensure best management practices and long-term sustainable
management ensures water quality, wildlife and timber conservation for
future generations. Our family is involved in important American
Chestnut restoration with the New York Chapter of the American Chestnut
Society on the property. I, as well as my family, would therefore be
impacted financially, physically, and on a very real level, spiritually,
from the proposed project #15056.

Not only is this property invaluable to me and my family, the proposed
reservoir construction and operation would generate unacceptable risk to
New York City DEP’s unfiltered water supply downstream in the Ashokan
Reservoir via numerous short-term and long-term impacts. The property
currently serves an important role in maintaining the unfiltered water
supply for New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC
DEP) via its contribution to the high- water quality currently found in
Woodland Valley Creek, its floodplains, and several tributaries and
wetlands located on the property. The proposed reservoir and pumped
storage operation would literally destroy all of these important
hydrological resources. Construction of the reservoir dam, associated
blasting for the dam and connecting underground tunnel, land clearing
and clearcutting to remove standing vegetation beneath the reservoir
pool, and roadbuilding to replace many miles of Woodland Valley Road
would all cause significant fine sediment, turbidity and water quality
impacts to Woodland Creek, Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir for
many years. But the major water quality impacts would not be limited to
the 5 or more years of construction and disturbance: the daily
fluctuation of the proposed Woodland Valley Reservoir to serve the
pumped storage needs would erode and resuspend fine sediment and
colloidal clay found in numerous naturally-occurring glacial lacustrine
clay deposits throughout the stream, floodplain and valley. The
underlying geology therefore would contribute turbidity to Esopus Creek
and the Ashokan reservoir potentially on a daily basis, causing great
impact and unacceptable risk to New York City’s drinking water supply to
over 9 million people.

The Woodland Creek serves as an important and valued recreational
resource in its current state for me and my family as well. The Woodland
Creek is a storied wild trout fishery, and provides very significant
spawning and rearing habitat for wild brook, brown and rainbow trout
which migrate annually from the Ashokan Reservoir and the Esopus Creek
to use these fertile headwaters to spawn. The proposed reservoir would
eliminate the current fishery within more than 3 miles of Woodland
Creek, it would forever sever the vital connection of more than 13 miles
of coldwater habitat used by trout in the Esopus Creek/Ashokan Reservoir
causing significant impact to this recreationally valuable fishery. If
the proposed project is permitted to be constructed, it would also
degrade the Esopus Creek fishery downstream from altered water
temperature, sediment regime and water quality impacts from the proposed
reservoir construction and operation. Due to the potential negative
effects of the proposed pumped storage reservoir on the Woodland Creek,
Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir and their cherished wild trout
fishery, I am filing as an intervenor as well.

suite of lower-elevation forest nesting birds. Many of these are
considered species of Special Concern or Threatened in New York State,
or Species of Greatest Conservation Need and include American Black
Duck, Osprey, Bald Eagle, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper’s Hawk, Northern
Goshawk, Red-shouldered Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, American Woodcock,
Olive-sided Flycatcher, Wood Thrush, Scarlet Tanager, Cerulean Warbler,
Black-throated Blue Warbler, and Canada Warbler. In addition to state
protections, Bald Eagle is afforded federal protection under the Bald
and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Ashokan Reservoir, as part of the
IBA, is an important site for wintering waterfowl and it is unknown how
water depth fluctuations from this project would affect those birds.

Permanent protection of this IBA is of utmost importance to protecting
the aforementioned species. This project, if approved, would fragment
the forest to the detriment of those species, as well as species
currently not identified as in need of protections.

We urge FERC to stop this project before much time and money are
needlessly spent, given that further, detailed negative environmental
effects that will certainly be identified in an EIS if the project is
approved to move to the next step.

RE: MOTION TO INTERVENE ON PROJECT # 15056-000, ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE
PROJECT

Dear FERC,

I am filing a motion to intervene for proposed project #15056, Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project. I co-own 9.1 acres of property at 624 Woodland
Valley Rd (24.8.1.11), and am a member of Woodland Valley Woods, LLC, 20
acres in size, and Woodland Valley Farm, LLC, approximately 105 acres in
size, which would be inundated by the proposed reservoir in Woodland
Valley associated with the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Our family has owned and lived on this property since 1835, making me a
seventh-generation owner of land that would have to be taken away by
imminent domain to be buried forever under water. The property includes
a homestead constructed in 1865 following the conclusion of the Civil
War and an original barn built in that era. We have a gravesite on the
property, and numerous family heirlooms from generations of family who
were born on, who served the military during the Civil War, the First
World War and World War II, who worked, and who died on this property.
Our family has invested significant time in collaboration with NYC DEP
to serve as good stewards of the property in its important role in
contributing clean drinking water downstream to New York residents,
including the sale of a 97-acre conservation easement to NYC DEP in 2014
that sacrificed our right to further subdivide and develop much of the
property in perpetuity to help ensure watershed protection. We adopted a
Forest Management Stewardship plan through NYC DEP in 2014 and entered
the Woodland Valley Woods, LLC property into the National Tree Farm
System to ensure best management practices and long-term sustainable
management ensures water quality, wildlife and timber conservation for
future generations. Our family is involved in important American
Chestnut restoration with the New York Chapter of the American Chestnut
Society on the property. I, as well as my family, would therefore be
impacted financially, physically, and on a very real level, spiritually,
from the proposed project #15056.

Not only is this property invaluable to me and my family, the proposed
reservoir construction and operation would generate unacceptable risk to
New York City DEP’s unfiltered water supply downstream in the Ashokan
Reservoir via numerous short-term and long-term impacts. The property
currently serves an important role in maintaining the unfiltered water
supply for New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC
DEP) via its contribution to the high- water quality currently found in
Woodland Valley Creek, its floodplains, and several tributaries and
wetlands located on the property. The proposed reservoir and pumped
storage operation would literally destroy all of these important
hydrological resources. Construction of the reservoir dam, associated
blasting for the dam and connecting underground tunnel, land clearing
and clearcutting to remove standing vegetation beneath the reservoir
pool, and roadbuilding to replace many miles of Woodland Valley Road
would all cause significant fine sediment, turbidity and water quality
impacts to Woodland Creek, Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir for
many years. But the major water quality impacts would not be limited to
the 5 or more years of construction and disturbance: the daily
fluctuation of the proposed Woodland Valley Reservoir to serve the
pumped storage needs would erode and resuspend fine sediment and
colloidal clay found in numerous naturally-occurring glacial lacustrine
clay deposits throughout the stream, floodplain and valley. The
underlying geology therefore would contribute turbidity to Esopus Creek
and the Ashokan reservoir potentially on a daily basis, causing great
impact and unacceptable risk to New York City’s drinking water supply to
over 9 million people.

The Woodland Creek serves as an important and valued recreational
resource in its current state for me and my family as well. The Woodland
Creek is a storied wild trout fishery, and provides very significant
spawning and rearing habitat for wild brook, brown and rainbow trout
which migrate annually from the Ashokan Reservoir and the Esopus Creek
to use these fertile headwaters to spawn. The proposed reservoir would
eliminate the current fishery within more than 3 miles of Woodland
Creek, it would forever sever the vital connection of more than 13 miles
of coldwater habitat used by trout in the Esopus Creek/Ashokan Reservoir
causing significant impact to this recreationally valuable fishery. If
the proposed project is permitted to be constructed, it would also
degrade the Esopus Creek fishery downstream from altered water
temperature, sediment regime and water quality impacts from the proposed
reservoir construction and operation. Due to the potential negative
effects of the proposed pumped storage reservoir on the Woodland Creek,
Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir and their cherished wild trout
fishery, I am filing as an intervenor as well.

The proposed project is located within the Catskill Peaks Important Bird

Goshawk, Red-shouldered Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, American Woodcock,
Olive-sided Flycatcher, Wood Thrush, Scarlet Tanager, Cerulean Warbler,

DEP) via its contribution to the high- water quality currently found in
Woodland Valley Creek, its floodplains, and several tributaries and
wetlands located on the property. The proposed reservoir and pumped
storage operation would literally destroy all of these important
hydrological resources. Construction of the reservoir dam, associated
blasting for the dam and connecting underground tunnel, land clearing
and clearcutting to remove standing vegetation beneath the reservoir
pool, and roadbuilding to replace many miles of Woodland Valley Road
would all cause significant fine sediment, turbidity and water quality
impacts to Woodland Creek, Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir for
many years. But the major water quality impacts would not be limited to
the 5 or more years of construction and disturbance: the daily
fluctuation of the proposed Woodland Valley Reservoir to serve the
pumped storage needs would erode and resuspend fine sediment and
colloidal clay found in numerous naturally-occurring glacial lacustrine
clay deposits throughout the stream, floodplain and valley. The
underlying geology therefore would contribute turbidity to Esopus Creek
and the Ashokan reservoir potentially on a daily basis, causing great
impact and unacceptable risk to New York City’s drinking water supply to
over 9 million people.

The Woodland Creek serves as an important and valued recreational
resource in its current state for me and my family as well. The Woodland
Creek is a storied wild trout fishery, and provides very significant
spawning and rearing habitat for wild brook, brown and rainbow trout
which migrate annually from the Ashokan Reservoir and the Esopus Creek
to use these fertile headwaters to spawn. The proposed reservoir would
eliminate the current fishery within more than 3 miles of Woodland
Creek, it would forever sever the vital connection of more than 13 miles
of coldwater habitat used by trout in the Esopus Creek/Ashokan Reservoir
causing significant impact to this recreationally valuable fishery. If
the proposed project is permitted to be constructed, it would also
degrade the Esopus Creek fishery downstream from altered water
temperature, sediment regime and water quality impacts from the proposed
reservoir construction and operation. Due to the potential negative
effects of the proposed pumped storage reservoir on the Woodland Creek,
Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir and their cherished wild trout
fishery, I am filing as an intervenor as well.

Sincerely,

discovering the brook for the first time:

But the prettiest thing was the stream soliloquizing in such musical

the Indian; only in such remote woods can you now see a brook in all its
original freshness and beauty. Only the sea and the mountain forest
brook are pure; all between is contaminated more or less by the work of
man. An ideal trout brook was this, now hurrying, now loitering, now
deepening around a great boulder, now gliding evenly over a pavement of
green-gray stone and pebbles; no sediment or stain of any kind, but
white and sparkling as snow-water, and nearly as cool. Indeed, the water
of all this Catskill region is the best in the world. For the first few
days, one feels as if he could almost live on the water alone.; he
cannot drink enough of it. In this particular it is indeed the good
bible land, “a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that
spring out of valleys and hills.”

The brook is the particular reason many of the valley’s homeowners chose
to live there. And when it comes their time to die, rather than be
consigned to a cemetery, their emotional attachment is such that they
prefer to have their ashes joined with the brook.

I make no apology for waxing poetic about my boyhood stream. It would be
a sin, a travesty, to permit an energy company to decimate Woodland
Brook. What follows will give you a further idea of how I feel on the
subject.

Thank you.

WOODLAND BROOK

Thoughts of the brook consume me.

There’s early spring, when the water runs

Fast and blue and the shadblow blooms pure white

All along the valley corridor.

My father directs me to use a quill Gordon.

Iron Fraudator hatches while the last

Thin snow falls.

Grandpa was right.

Life is not all skittles and beer.

Even on a bright Memorial Day,

You can find evidence of Winter’s

Harsh directive.

The stench of rotting flesh hits us

Like a wall, as we crash through

Sinewy brush, lugging heavy buckets

Of stocking trout.

The doe’s body was hidden in deep water,

Until this sudden dry spell.

Lately she has become the uncontested property,

Of recalcitrant valley dogs and buzzflies.

In summer the brook dwindles to a crystalline trickle,

Under a demanding sun, grasshoppers bask

In the hot dust and fiddle beneath the black-eyed suzies.

Cautious trout maintain themselves in the shade

Of willows and smooth children’s jumping rocks

They wait for nighttime when they will fill with

Brash courage and feed in a frenzy on top.

Take your rod and visit them then.

To Hell with the cocktail hour.

Cold wet autumn, when the slate drakes hatch

Leaving their skinhusks behind like gossamer souvenirs of their

First life. As May flies, they flutter off through the rain

To begin their brief climactic last-life.

There is the Grandparent’s pool,

Where we laid my parents’ ashes,

First his in his year of death, then her’s.

Angler’s ashes in the waters they loved.

The brook holds them and venerates them,

As do we.

NATHAN DERSHOWITZ

Basis for Intervening:
NATHAN DERSHOWITZ seeks to intervene in this proceeding. He is a
landowner in Woodland Valley and if the Woodland Valley site is chosen,
he will no longer have access to his property. Accordingly, Nathan
Dershowitz has a substantial interest in this matter. No other party
represents Nathan Dershowitz, and no other party is authorized to
represent Mr. Dershowitz’s unique interests. For the foregoing reasons,
Mr. Dershowitz respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Merits objection.

As I understand the Preliminary Permit application, a private party,
Premium Energy Holding, seeks to secure the federal eminent domain power
to potentially flood a large section of Woodland Valley. The claimed
purpose is to store water to supplement energy needs. The proposal does
not make clear who would own the condemned property. More importantly,
it is unclear as to whether there will be any public benefit from this
project. The proponent is a for-profit entity and will presumably sell
the energy to the city, state or federal Government. Thus, this proposal
is not a standard creation of a reservoir, for a public use or the
public good. It is a private entities effort to make money. The project
will not create additional energy, but by arbitrage, the private company
will make money and may or may not make energy minimally cheaper for the
public. Even if sold at a cheap price the economic benefit to the public
seems disproportionately low, compared to the cost and public harm of
this project. This and other legitimate objections have and will be
raised throughout these proceedings by me and others.

I write now to raise additional constitutional objections. First,
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states ‘nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’ By its
terms, the Fifth Amendment does not authorize the taking of state land
by eminent domain. Here, the New York State Constitution Article XIV
makes certain State land forever wild. The State Constitution requires
that certain state land shall not be taken by any corporation, public or
private. To circumvent this provision is a long and timely process,
which very rarely is successful. Some State land in Woodland Valley
would be flooded by this project. The Tenth Amendment provides “[t]he
powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.” The issue of whether, even if prior Supreme Court
decisions would allow Federal eminent domain to be used over the
objection of a state for the confiscation of state land, the present
proposal is extremely suspect as a basis for exercising eminent domain
over State land now being used for the public good. The “public use”
requirement of the Fifth Amendment is hard to justify here and the State
Constitutional establishment of the public good of keeping the property
forever wild cannot be ignored. There are serious questions as to
whether the present Supreme Court of the United States would allow this
project to proceed by use of eminent domain. The present composition of
the Court will, I believe, view the Tenth Amendment as being more
significant as applied to the facts of this situation, than prior courts
did in clearer “public use” cases and will defer to the State
Constitutional assertion of the benefit of forever wild land use.

Similarly, using or delegating eminent domain to and for a private party
for the private party’s personal profit—when the actual benefit to the
public is so speculative—raises other constitutional issues. The public
use or benefit does not flow here from the creation of the reservoir. If
there is any public benefit it would come from the private party selling
its energy. Whether that would be a public benefit would depend on what
the parties negotiate in the future. That is too speculative and
variable a bases for asserting a public benefit. The Supreme Court’s
five-to-four decision in _Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S.469(2005)_
will, in my view, not be extended by the present members of the Court
for a private-to-private transfer in the present situation. Even if the
flooded property is thereafter owned by the Federal or State Government,
herein a private purpose is afoot. Justice Stevens expressly noted for
the majority that “a one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside
the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this
case. While such an unusual exercise of government power would certainly
raise a suspicion that a private purpose was afoot, the hypothetical
cases posited by petitioners can be confronted if and when they arise.”
The present situation seems to present that open question. Private
property will be taken to allow another private party to make a profit
and the hoped for increase in cheap energy will be in the hands of the
second private party. Equally importantly, the four-member dissent in
_Kelo_ seems to reflect the view of the present majority of the Supreme
Court, more than does the majority opinion in _Kelo_.

My view is that the FERC should evaluate these constitutional issues
before an expensive and extensive expenditure of time and money is
wasted on a project with speculative public benefit and clearly
articulated Constitutional declared harm to public area used extensively
for the public good. Pumped storage hydro plants appear to be an
important part of our goal to use renewable energy. But the present
proposal presents a very bad set of facts upon which to proceed.</pre>The above text is a conversion and thus may not be formatted correctly. To read the file in it's original form

NATHAN DERSHOWITZ

Basis for Intervening:
NATHAN DERSHOWITZ seeks to intervene in this proceeding. He is a
landowner in Woodland Valley and if the Woodland Valley site is chosen,
he will no longer have access to his property. Accordingly, Nathan
Dershowitz has a substantial interest in this matter. No other party
represents Nathan Dershowitz, and no other party is authorized to
represent Mr. Dershowitz’s unique interests. For the foregoing reasons,
Mr. Dershowitz respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Merits objection.

As I understand the Preliminary Permit application, a private party,
Premium Energy Holding, seeks to secure the federal eminent domain power
to potentially flood a large section of Woodland Valley. The claimed
purpose is to store water to supplement energy needs. The proposal does
not make clear who would own the condemned property. More importantly,
it is unclear as to whether there will be any public benefit from this
project. The proponent is a for-profit entity and will presumably sell
the energy to the city, state or federal Government. Thus, this proposal
is not a standard creation of a reservoir, for a public use or the
public good. It is a private entities effort to make money. The project
will not create additional energy, but by arbitrage, the private company
will make money and may or may not make energy minimally cheaper for the
public. Even if sold at a cheap price the economic benefit to the public
seems disproportionately low, compared to the cost and public harm of
this project. This and other legitimate objections have and will be
raised throughout these proceedings by me and others.

I write now to raise additional constitutional objections. First,
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states ‘nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’ By its
terms, the Fifth Amendment does not authorize the taking of state land
by eminent domain. Here, the New York State Constitution Article XIV

that certain state land shall not be taken by any corporation, public or
private. To circumvent this provision is a long and timely process,
which very rarely is successful. Some State land in Woodland Valley

prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.” The issue of whether, even if prior Supreme Court
decisions would allow Federal eminent domain to be used over the
objection of a state for the confiscation of state land, the present
proposal is extremely suspect as a basis for exercising eminent domain
over State land now being used for the public good. The “public use”
requirement of the Fifth Amendment is hard to justify here and the State

herein a private purpose is afoot. Justice Stevens expressly noted for

NOTICE OF PRELIMINARY PERMIT APPLICATION ACCEPTED FOR FILING AND
SOLICITING COMMENTS, MOTIONS TO INTERVENE, AND COMPETING APPLICATIONS

(February 11, 2020)

On November 19, 2020, Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, filed an application
for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Federal Power
Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project to be located 14 miles west of the City of Kingston in
Ulster County, New York. The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if
issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license
application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not
authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or
otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners’
express permission.

The proposed project would consist of the following: (1) a new
2,618-foot-long, 212-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 1 (Stony Clove Reservoir) with a surface
area of 245 acres and a storage capacity 22,496 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,500 feet above mean sea level (msl); (2) a new
2,736-foot-long, 232-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 2 (Woodland Reservoir) with a surface
area of 313 acres and a storage capacity 26,231 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,210 feet msl; (3) a new 2,527-foot-long, 304-foot-high
roller-compacted concrete dam for the upper reservoir for alternative 3
(Wittenberg Reservoir) with a surface area of 226 acres and a storage
capacity 25,558 acre-feet at a surface elevation of 1,180 feet msl; (4)
the existing Ashokan Reservoir for the lower reservoir with a surface
area of 8,300 acres and a storage capacity of 382,358 acre-feet at a
surface elevation of 585 feet msl; (5) new 13.99-mile-long tunnels,
shafts, and penstocks for alternative 1 connecting the upper and lower
reservoirs; (6) new 11.58-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for
alternative 2 connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (7) new
3.81-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for alternative 3
connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (8) a new 500-foot-long,
125-foot-wide, 150-foot-high underground reinforced-concrete powerhouse
containing five turbine-generator units with a total rated capacity of
800 megawatts; (9) a 17.3-mile-long, 230-kilovolt new transmission line
for alternatives 1 and 2 from the proposed Ashokan switchyard to the
existing Hurley avenue substation; (10) a 12.9-mile-long, 230-kilovolt
new transmission line for alternative 3 from the proposed Ashokan
switchyard to the existing Hurley avenue substation; and (11)
appurtenant facilities. The proposed project would have a maximum annual
generation of 2,700 gigawatt-hours.

SOLICITING COMMENTS, MOTIONS TO INTERVENE, AND COMPETING APPLICATIONS

(February 11, 2020)

On November 19, 2020, Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, filed an application
for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Federal Power
Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project to be located 14 miles west of the City of Kingston in
Ulster County, New York. The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if
issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license
application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not
authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or
otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners’
express permission.

The proposed project would consist of the following: (1) a new
2,618-foot-long, 212-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 1 (Stony Clove Reservoir) with a surface
area of 245 acres and a storage capacity 22,496 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,500 feet above mean sea level (msl); (2) a new
2,736-foot-long, 232-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 2 (Woodland Reservoir) with a surface
area of 313 acres and a storage capacity 26,231 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,210 feet msl; (3) a new 2,527-foot-long, 304-foot-high
roller-compacted concrete dam for the upper reservoir for alternative 3
(Wittenberg Reservoir) with a surface area of 226 acres and a storage
capacity 25,558 acre-feet at a surface elevation of 1,180 feet msl; (4)
the existing Ashokan Reservoir for the lower reservoir with a surface
area of 8,300 acres and a storage capacity of 382,358 acre-feet at a
surface elevation of 585 feet msl; (5) new 13.99-mile-long tunnels,
shafts, and penstocks for alternative 1 connecting the upper and lower
reservoirs; (6) new 11.58-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for
alternative 2 connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (7) new
3.81-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for alternative 3
connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (8) a new 500-foot-long,
125-foot-wide, 150-foot-high underground reinforced-concrete powerhouse
containing five turbine-generator units with a total rated capacity of
800 megawatts; (9) a 17.3-mile-long, 230-kilovolt new transmission line
for alternatives 1 and 2 from the proposed Ashokan switchyard to the
existing Hurley avenue substation; (10) a 12.9-mile-long, 230-kilovolt
new transmission line for alternative 3 from the proposed Ashokan
switchyard to the existing Hurley avenue substation; and (11)
appurtenant facilities. The proposed project would have a maximum annual
generation of 2,700 gigawatt-hours.
