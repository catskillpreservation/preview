Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise

Walnut, CA. Jennifer Christie is filing a motion to be an intervener and
meets the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commission’s regulations
to be granted full party status. 

The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project
Project No. 15056-000 the proposed project path of the tunnel would
directly go under our property endangering our access to clean water for
our family and substantially affect the property value of our home and
investment properties that support our retirement. Therefore, I have
substantial interest in the matter. I reside on 18 Silver Hollow,
Chichester, NY.  

Jennifer Christie respectfully requests that the Federal Energy

  Re: DOCKET P-15056-000 

  MOTION TO INTERVENE of Melissa Rabuffo for the Premium Energy
  Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056

  Dear Secretary Bose, 

This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed PROJECT NO. 15056-000, Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC,
Walnut, CA. Jennifer Christie is filing a motion to be an intervener and
meets the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commission’s regulations
to be granted full party status. 

The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project
Project No. 15056-000 the proposed project path of the tunnel would
directly go under our property endangering our access to clean water for
our family and substantially affect the property value of our home and
investment properties that support our retirement. Therefore, I have
substantial interest in the matter. I reside on 18 Silver Hollow,
Chichester, NY.  

Melissa Rabuffo respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene. 

  Respectfully, 

  Jennifer Christie

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary

continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and

aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim, it is in fact an “add-on”. As such,
water fluctuations would increase turbidity within the Ashokan Reservoir
and watershed. The Ashokan is the largest unfiltered water supply in the
nation. It represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s.
It would be reckless to allow this project to proceed.

In addition, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local
communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest
Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via
eminent domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the
Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten.
There is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for
affordable homes. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would have difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem
of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect
on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and seasonal programming at Hunter Mountain Ski Center, towns of Hunter
and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively
affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and

West Shokan, NY 12494

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent

currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not

opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a

I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for

devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s drinking water.

Pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may play a role in our
country’s transition to renewable energy. However, the pristinely and
protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve
must not be sacrificed. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is
clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild
forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken
by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve is unique in that
it currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat which
we should keep intact. The forest around the proposed sites ranks among
the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York
State Forest Condition Index. There are rare plants and animals
throughout the Catskill Forest Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is
habitat for the rare Three Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which
is registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North
America by the NY Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS
Dept. of Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The
Orchids as well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project
be approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim, it is in fact an “add-on”. As such,
water fluctuations would increase turbidity within the Ashokan Reservoir
and watershed. The Ashokan is the largest unfiltered water supply in the
nation. It represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s.
It would be reckless to allow this project to proceed.

In addition, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local
communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest
Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via
eminent domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the
Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten.
There is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for
affordable homes. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would have difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem
of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect
on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and seasonal programming at Hunter Mountain Ski Center, towns of Hunter
and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively
affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and

West Shokan, NY 12494

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

David Schneider</pre>The above text is a conversion and thus may not be formatted correctly. To read the file in it's original form

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be

Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped

represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in NYS Catskill Mountains.
I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for
the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s drinking water.

Pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may play a role in our
country’s transition to renewable energy. However, the pristinely and
protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve
must not be sacrificed. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is
clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild
forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken
by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve is unique in that
it currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat which
we should keep intact. The forest around the proposed sites ranks among
the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York
State Forest Condition Index. There are rare plants and animals
throughout the Catskill Forest Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is
habitat for the rare Three Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which
is registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North
America by the NY Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS
Dept. of Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The
Orchids as well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project
be approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim, it is in fact an “add-on”. As such,
water fluctuations would increase turbidity within the Ashokan Reservoir
and watershed. The Ashokan is the largest unfiltered water supply in the
nation. It represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s.
It would be reckless to allow this project to proceed.

In addition, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local
communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest
Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via
eminent domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the
Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten.
There is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for
affordable homes. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would have difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem
of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect
on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and seasonal programming at Hunter Mountain Ski Center, towns of Hunter
and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively
affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust

West Shokan, NY 12494

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

  Re: DOCKET P-15056-000 

  MOTION TO INTERVENE of Melissa Rabuffo for the Premium Energy
  Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056

  Dear Secretary Bose, 

This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed PROJECT NO. 15056-000, Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC,
Walnut, CA. Melissa Rabuffo is filing a motion to be an intervener and
meets the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commission’s regulations
to be granted full party status. 

The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project
Project No. 15056-000 would affect our business and the project path of
the tunnel would directly go under our property endangering our access
to clean water for our family and substantially affect the property
value of our home. Therefore, I have substantial interest in the matter.
I reside on 59 Cinder Road, Chichester, NY.  

Melissa Rabuffo respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene. 

  Respectfully, 

  Melissa Rabuffo

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest

Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as

community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5

1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water

since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in NYS Catskill Mountains.
I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for
the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s drinking water.

Pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may play a role in our
country’s transition to renewable energy. However, the pristinely and
protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve
must not be sacrificed. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is
clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild
forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken
by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve is unique in that
it currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat which
we should keep intact. The forest around the proposed sites ranks among
the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York
State Forest Condition Index. There are rare plants and animals
throughout the Catskill Forest Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is
habitat for the rare Three Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which
is registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North
America by the NY Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS
Dept. of Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The
Orchids as well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project
be approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim, it is in fact an “add-on”. As such,
water fluctuations would increase turbidity within the Ashokan Reservoir
and watershed. The Ashokan is the largest unfiltered water supply in the
nation. It represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s.
It would be reckless to allow this project to proceed.

In addition, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local
communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest
Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via
eminent domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the
Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten.
There is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for
affordable homes. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would have difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem
of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect
on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and seasonal programming at Hunter Mountain Ski Center, towns of Hunter
and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively
affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest

Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of

devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the

Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous

and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in NYS Catskill Mountains.
I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for
the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s drinking water.

Pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may play a role in our
country’s transition to renewable energy. However, the pristinely and
protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve
must not be sacrificed. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is
clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild
forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken
by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve is unique in that
it currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat which
we should keep intact. The forest around the proposed sites ranks among
the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York
State Forest Condition Index. There are rare plants and animals
throughout the Catskill Forest Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is
habitat for the rare Three Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which
is registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North
America by the NY Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS
Dept. of Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The
Orchids as well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project
be approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage

and watershed. The Ashokan is the largest unfiltered water supply in the

limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and seasonal programming at Hunter Mountain Ski Center, towns of Hunter
and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively
affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy

There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest

Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to
see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental
impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds making them
eligible for streamlined FERC approval. In an unethical attempt to get
FERC approval, Premium Energy is falsely claiming this project is a
“closed-loop” system. Premium needs to be honest about what this project
is. It is an “add-on” system, using an existing body of water as a lower
reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher
risks, especially in this instance, when the lower reservoir is not a
vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in NYS Catskill Mountains.
I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for
the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s drinking water.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy

There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be

vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the
advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy resources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. It my
opinion that the Catskill Forest Preserve and communities within the
Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped
storage project—one where the construction and operation will not
destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,
and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

  [johns signature]

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy
Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill
Mountains. I urge the FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. This project
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and have a negative impact the purity of New York City’s
drinking water.

I understand that pumped storage and other hydroelectric projects may
play a role in our country’s transition to renewable energy. However,
the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill
Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV
of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands
“shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,
sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
The Preserve unique in that it currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat which we should keep intact. The forest
around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats
region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
There are rare plants and animals throughout the Catskill Forest
Preserve. The Whittenberg Brook site is a location for the rare Three
Birds Orchid (Triphora trianthophora) which is registered in the
Biological and Conservation Database for North America by the New York
Natural Heritage Program, an agency funded by the NYS Department of
Environmental Conservation and The Nature Conservancy. The Orchids as
well as their habitat will be obliterated should this project be
approved. It would be unconscionable to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land. Such action would set a terrible precedent
for protected lands across the country.

This project would cause environmental devastation due to the
interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped
storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology, on
aquatic and land habitats because of rapid fluctuation in water levels.
These rapid fluctuations will alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the
key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a
day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a
closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on”. As such, the
water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan
and its watershed. The Ashokan Reservoir is the largest unfiltered water
supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments
since the 1990s alone. It would be reckless to allow this project to
proceed.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain. This process displaced thousands of residents when the Ashokan
was constructed 100 years ago, and this has not been forgotten. There is
currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for affordable homes.
Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have
difficulty securing new housing. Beyond the problem of community
displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the
Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in
the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting
roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to
hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills,
decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and
concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster

Blue Line should be off limits to such development. I hope Premium
Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped

for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be
devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities,

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or

and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would

RE: FERC Docket # P-15056 – Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056, the Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC. I
request that you deny this preliminary permit application immediately.

As a resident and small business owner in West Shokan for over 30 years,
I will be directly impacted by the proposed project throughout the
proposal and development phases as well as during ongoing operations.
Our B&amp;B, Ashokan Dreams, overlooks the west basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. We start and end each day looking out over the entire length
of the upper basin of this reservoir from the Esopus Creek to the
dividing weir. Our B&amp;B is housed in a barn built by the Eckert Brothers
in 1820. The Eckerts built 2 barns, this one survived, the other one was
destroyed for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. We have a fishing
boat on the Ashokan Reservoir in West Shokan as do hundreds of other
residents who frequently and safely use the Reservoir for fishing. The
proposed infrastructure development and power lines will be visible and
impact and harm not only our business and community, but all visitors to
the new Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) which runs directly along the north
eastern shore of the Ashokan Reservoir. There were over 200,000 visitors
to the ART in 2020.

I understand that FERC does not normally deny a preliminary permit, but
this applicant has not met a minimum standard to achieve legal and
regulatory approvals, nor to deal with environmental issues their
proposal will create, nor have they presented a design that is realistic
nor that meets modern design best practices for a closed loop pump
storage system. I also understand that the impact to my property value,
to my personal quality of life and experiences or my safety or the
safety of the community, as well as the disruptions to my business,
visitors and the community that has been disrupted for over 100 years by
the building and operations of the current Ashokan Reservoir, does not
warrant stopping this proposal at this phase but I appreciate your
consideration of these issues.
In addition to being a resident of this community for over 40 years, I
am also a board member of the Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of
Trout Unlimited, an Intervenor in this process along with the NY State
Council of Trout Unlimited (TU). TU is committed to conserving,
protecting, and restoring cold water fisheries and their ecosystems. I
am also an Executive Committee member of the Ashokan Watershed Stream
Management Plan (AWSMP) Stakeholder Council. This organization delivers
stream management programs in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed in
accordance with the Watershed Memorandum of Agreement and the Filtration
Avoidance Determination for the NYC Water Supply. These activities and
experiences inform my understanding of the environmental and regulatory
issues this project proposal presents and therefore I offer my comments.

A legal review of this proposal, a proposal that depends upon the taking
of NYS Forest Preserve Lands that are protected by the NYS Constitution
and the use and taking of NYC Watershed lands that are also protected
and regulated, appears to present insurmountable legal hurdles. Adding
the need for DEC permitting of operations that will disrupt the already
fragile geological structures of this region and the known issues with
glacial clays, and thereby disrupt and harm the wild fisheries and the
water supply for 9 million people demonstrates that that this is a
poorly conceived proposal that should not be allowed to proceed at this
phase by the precedents established by FERC. A review of the failed
Prattsville Pumped Storage Project, No. 2729 on the NYC Schoharie
Reservoir in the Catskills illuminates the issues and the probabilities
of receiving needed permits within a critical water supply ecosystem.
One of the most significant ecological and health risks in this Water
Supply is turbidity. Turbidity is a product of the geology of the
Catskills. It is insurmountable and has been a product of the erosive
formation of the Catskills over the last 10,000 years. Introducing more
turbidity or disrupting the natural cycles of turbidity will affect not
only the environment and fisheries, but also the NYC water supply and
potentially the water supplies of communities dependent upon the Hudson
River. The management of this unfiltered water supply is guided by the
NYC Memorandum of Agreement with the EPA, NYS and watershed communities
and now monitored by the NYS DOH. That MOA created a set of Filtration
Avoidance Determination obligations, and the most significant management
issue for water quality is turbidity. The applicant has not considered
any of this in their Project Proposal. A review of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports from 2000, 2010
and 2020 highlight the challenges and requirements for the watershed
wide management of this critical water supply ecosystem to avoid water
supply filtration and its costs.

From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report &#34;Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply: Assessing the New
York City Strategy&#34; (2000), p.88.
&#34;The Watershed Rules and Regulations of the New York City Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) are among the most comprehensive and detailed
regulations regarding watershed activities found in this country.
However, they cannot be considered in isolation given the large number
of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations with which New
York City must comply. This chapter briefly describes the initial
impetus for the creation of environmental regulations relating to
drinking water, it outlines certain federal regulations that pertain to
the New York City drinking water supply, and it describes how the MOA
attempts to fill gaps between federal, state, and local environmental
regulations.&#34; ….
&#34;Although watershed management is important for any surface water
supply, it is critical for an unfiltered supply. The MOA is a remarkable
document and a significant milestone in the City’s water supply and the
region’s development. Successful implementation of the MOA is the most
important challenge facing the City’s water supply managers. &#34; There was
no analysis by the applicant of how this pump storage proposal will
affect the current predictive models for water supply operations which
will impact water supply quality or quantity and potentially impact
community safety by disrupting the flood control component of water
supply management. This will affect communities downstream of the
Ashokan Reservoir, all the way to the Hudson River, and potentially
affect the communities the use the Hudson River for their water
supplies.
The alternative sites for an upper reservoir will dam streams that carry
high loads of coarse sediment (bed load) through steep mountain valleys.
As proposed, the upper reservoir dams will interrupt 100% of the coarse
sediment supply. Bed load is needed to re-form stream riffles and other
channel stabilizing features downstream of the reservoir dam. Stream
riffles and other natural channel features armor stream beds against
erosion. Streams located downstream of newly constructed dams are highly
likely to become unstable and erode downward and laterally following dam
construction during a period of adjustment. This adjustment period or
channel evolution is critical to the stream returning to an equilibrium
state following the disruption to hydrology and sediment supply caused
by dam construction and would likely occur over a period of decades. In
addition to downward adjustment of channels, a reduction in stream flow
downstream of a dam can lead to sediment accumulation in the channel bed
triggering stream bank erosion. In accordance with modern understandings
of stream physics confirmed through scientific study, it can be expected
that streams below a newly constructed dam will undergo erosion and
adjustment before a new channel configuration achieves hydraulic
stability (Williams and Wolman, 1984; Church, 1995; Grant, 2003). The
Ashokan Watershed’s geology is such that coarse bed load transported by
streams is frequently deposited over relatively deep deposits of clay
sediments that historically formed under glacial lakes. Channels starved
of bed load below a dam would likely erode into glacial lake clays and
substantially increase fine sediment loading to downstream water bodies,
including the Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir. Adjustments to the
channel bed and stream bank erosion raise the following concerns:

1)  Banks in this watershed include large hillslopes that are layered
    with the glacial lake clays that threaten water quality.

2)  Extensive bank erosion could undermine existing public culverts and
    bridges located on affected streams.

3)  Public roads by necessity are located near or adjacent to streams in
    steep mountain valleys and could be undermined.

4)  In this heavily forested watershed, bank erosion would likely
    increase the supply of large wood to channels, further contributing
    to channel instability and threatening public infrastructure.

5)  Private septic systems, buildings, and stream crossings could
    similarly be undermined.

The Upper Esopus Creek and minor tributaries between the Ashokan
Reservoir and Allaben are included on the NYS Section 303(d) List of
Impaired Waters. The NYC water supply, aquatic invertebrates, and
fishes, as well as recreational uses will be impaired by this increased
turbidity, silt and sediment. The upper pumped storage reservoir will
also disconnect spawning trout from upstream habitat and interrupt the
cold water wild trout needed to survive downstream of the new upper
storage reservoir.
Additionally, any waters pumped from the Ashokan Reservoir into the
upper pumped storage reservoir could significantly impact the existing
fragile ecosystems of the headwater tributaries:

1)  The pump water in the upper reservoir could introduce two
    significant pollutant into the fragile ecosystem and especially the
    downstream stream: warm water, and turbid water. Water pumped up to
    the new reservoir from the Ashokan will be significantly warmer than
    the ambient water temperatures and will be significantly more
    turbid. Any release into the downstream reaches would require SPEDES
    Permit from the DEC.

2)  Pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir into the upper pumped
    storage reservoir can also introduce non-native species of fishes
    and organisms into the upstream and downstream ecosystem of that
    upper reservoir.

3)  Unique heritage strains of wild brook trout populations that have
    been compromised and reduced until they can only be found in
    isolated headwater streams, will be at risk due to these pumping
    operations into headwater areas.

A review of the alternative sites for pumping and discharge
infrastructure in the Ashokan Reservoir as proposed indicate a poor
understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin water levels,
topography, and existing land use. The elevation of the upper basin
historically ranges from 594.84 feet above sea level to 530.56 feet
above sea level. Although the highest reservoir level is managed for dam
and community safety, and operated to provide a continuous water supply,
the lowest levels in the reservoir are dictated by natural
precipitation. Climate change will also have a significant impact on
these reservoir levels in the future. In 5 of the last 6 years the upper
basin of the Ashokan Reservoir has fallen below an elevation of 570 feet
above sea level. Based upon the proposal for a western bank pump
operation, it appears that the terminus of that operation would have to
be hundreds of yards away from the western shoreline. Having pump and
discharge operations below 570 feet will have a dramatic impact on
sediment movement in the reservoir and affect the delicate balance of
the thermocline in summer months. These operations could also create
other nonlinear disruptions that would result in seiches waves and would
further disrupt turbidity in the reservoir. A constant turbid state in
the Ashokan from operation of this project will adversely impact both
zooplankton and therefore affect the wild rainbow trout population. The
interconnection of the Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek fisheries has
long been recognized. Recently the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream,
under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. Locating the pumping
and discharge infrastructure on the North Eastern side of the Upper
Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir pose other unique issues. The Ashokan
Rail Trail, a linear park on Ulster County lands that pass-through NYC
Lands, runs along the entire shoreline where this alternative pump
infrastructure is proposed. With over 200,000 visitors in 2020, any
construction in this area will pose both another legal challenge and
significantly impact regional tourism.

Residents of Ulster County depend upon NYC DEP to provide Dam Safety and
Flood mitigation services. The applicant would need significant
coordination with NYC DEP and Reservoir Operations to continue to ensure
flood mitigation and safety to downstream residents of their upper
reservoir, but also as a part of the Ashokan Reservoir flood control
processes. The applicant must be responsible to ensure Dam Safety as
guided by FERC. The applicant would also have to provide Security and
Safety to the 9 million water supply customer against any terrorist
threats to the water supply commensurate to the efforts provided by the
NYC Water Supply Police and the NYC DEP.

As argued by the NYC DEP and based upon analysis of many environmental
experts, this application should be denied at this point in the process.
There are many fatal flaws in the Project Proposal including a lack of
site-specific considerations for very significant regulatory, legal,
environmental, safety and water supply requirements. Coordination of
system wide operational management, predictive modeling and planning,
Flood control and other environmental and regulatory requirements are
critical to operate within a water supply ecosystem.

Therefore, for all these reasons, I urge you to reject Premium Energy
Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056 for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Respectfully,

Chester Karwatowski

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you as a resident of Lanesville whose historic house
sits right in the middle of one of the proposed sites and a local
business owner in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium
Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s
Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it
would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric
projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable
energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of
Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under
Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these
lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or
private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous
wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment),
and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of
forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and
wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for
protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental
devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and
its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on
nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because
within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid
fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to
affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected
tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek,
which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one
of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40%
of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5
million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop
system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water
fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and
its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to
allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as
the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in
the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the
1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply,
Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve
would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent
domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was
constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as
there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes
that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of
community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on
the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of
employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion
industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would
limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the
Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing
and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise
dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster
County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not
even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy
wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller
environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds,
and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest
about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing
body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it
significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital
source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust
a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of
being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not
come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope
Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for
a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will
not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and
threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a
preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

RE: COMMENTS

  DOCKET # P-15056 – ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

Dear Secretary Bose:

On behalf of the New York Chapter of Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers (“NY
BHA”), a dedicated group of conservation-minded hunters and anglers in
the Catskills region and more broadly, the State of New York, we write
with respect to the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the
Commission by Premium Energy Holdings (“PEH”) for the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project (P-15056) (the “Project”). In particular, NY BHA intends
to convey our concerns about the potential negative impacts that the
Project will have on the Ashoken Reservoir and Esopus Creek watersheds,
as well as other sensitive Catskills resources important to the hunting
and angling community in this geographic area.

NY BHA is focused on advancing proven approaches to conserving wild
places and rich outdoor heritage. We strive to shine a positive light on
American wildlife and land conservation. New York has a strong history
of conservation, as well as some of the best hunting and fishing in
North America. NY BHA aims to carry on that legacy by providing bold,
science-driven conservation leadership led by hunters and anglers, and
to benefit residents of New York and beyond. To ensure high-quality
wildlife habitat, we stand for proper, sustainable management and
protection of the lands and waters that give New Yorkers the opportunity
to peacefully cast a fly to sipping trout or slip through the November
deer woods.

As a nonprofit organization with approximately 1,000 members in New York
State, many of which who reside in the Catskill Mountains, NY BHA has
numerous concerns regarding the potential negative impacts from the
Project. The Ashokan Reservoir and Esopus Creek watershed are noted cold
water fisheries important to the angling community. Additionally, the
surrounding lands are pristine habitat for flora and fauna (including
deer, bear, turkey and other game species) that act as a key piece of
the fishery ecosystem. These resources are important to the hunting and
angling community and thus, NY BHA has a special interest in their
preservation.

CATSKILL PARK

The Project lies within the “blue line” of the Catskill region of New
York. Catskill Park lies within this blue line, which are protected
lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State
Constitution. Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely
set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and
large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.
NYS Const. Art. XIV.

The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain. Assuming
its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is
whether such a taking is legally possible. In a case involving a FERC
certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s
sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into
court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land. _In re
PennEast Pipeline Co._, 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019). The Supreme Court
has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month. Even if the
Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold
issue of whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the
pipeline owner will prevail. The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much
more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline
across state land at issue in _PennEast_. More significantly, PEH would
need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may
raise a host of constitutional issues.

PROJECT IMPACTS

The trout streams of the Catskills are revered among fishermen across
the nation as the birthplace of American Fly Fishing. Further, the
Esopus watershed has been established as a historical and recreational
treasure of the Catskills that continues to attract thousands of
anglers, hikers, birders and hunters every year, benefitting local
businesses of all types. As an angling and hunting organization, NY BHA
is very concerned with the health of the trout that inhabit the Esopus
Creek. Water quality is the single most important element for a healthy
trout population. Trout require very clean, cold, well-oxygenated water,
and their current population in the Esopus indicates a high quality
stream for all forms life in the ecosystem. By the same token, trout are
very sensitive to habitat degradation. As it is, every year the
ecosystem of the Esopus is stressed with problems of maintaining cold
temperatures and adequate water levels during the hot summer months and
the negative impacts from a project of this size clearly threatens to
significantly alter this precious habitat.

Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed
forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park. Based on PEH’s First
Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of
many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the Park to
construct the impoundment dams, tunnels and halls for turbines and
transformers. More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will
need to be excavated and transported out of the park. With the exception
of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction
on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.

The operation phase of the Project would have a significant impact on
protected waterways. The PEH facility will continuously degrade the
aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus Creek, which is a “natural waterway”
that was impounded to create the Ashokan. Operating the PEH facility
will also change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary
to the Esopus. We expect numerous species a flora and fauna may be
negatively impacted by operation of the PEH facility, including without
limitation, the trout.

Operating the PEH facility will also endanger the water supply for
millions. The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply
system. By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs,
New York City has created a high quality water supply for its residents.
Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan resulting in turbid
discharges into the Esopus Creek. For over 100 years, the West Basin has
served as a settling pond for water entering the reservoir; silt drops
from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the
City’s intake port is located. A study of water years from 2010 to 2012
found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin
annually. Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per
year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt
resting on the bottom of the West Basin. PEH estimates it will pump
15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily
basis. Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt re-suspend
accumulated silt, impacting the ability of the West Basin to absorb
incoming silt and consequently, potentially causing higher temperatures
and turbidity with the releases into the Esopus Creek.

Based upon the application materials provided, NY BHA identifies
potential negative impacts to the following: water quality; fish,
insect, wildlife and habitat; numerous intermittent streams and
wetlands; and historical and recreational preservation.

CONCLUSION

 

NY BHA, by this letter, presents some significant issues that concern
our members regarding this Project. Due to the numerous foreseeable
negative impacts mentioned above, the continued preservation of one of
the most unique cultural and recreational resources in the Catskills is
in serious jeopardy. Any negative impacts to the trout habitat and/or
the diverse ecosystems on the Ashoken and Esopus watershed will have
far-reaching effects for fishing and hunting, and the many aspects of
the local economy related to it, in this portion of the Catskills.

NY BHA recognizes the need for energy storage alternatives. Adequate
capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted,
sources makes alternative energy more economically viable. However, such
development can, and must, be undertaken in a thoughtful, responsible
manner that does not jeopardize the tremendous natural resources that
make the this portion of the Catskills so special, unique, and
environmentally and economically important. A project on the scale
proposed by PEH is incompatible with the Catskill region and any
proposed development which cannot be undertaken without such negative
impacts, should not be allowed to proceed. Thus, we respectfully request
that FERC deny the pending Permit application and this proposed Project.

Thank you for your considerations.

  Very truly yours,

I live in the hamlet of Chichester, Town of
Shandaken, Ulster County, in New York State. My FERC ID is #F648314.

I strongly oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy
Holdings (PEH) for the project to build a pumped storage hydroelectric
plant utilizing the Ashokan Reservoir (docket number P-15056).

I oppose it for the following reasons:

1.  The entire proposed project lies within the Catskill Forest
      Preserve, which has been protected in the New York State
      Constitution since 1894.

2.  The proposed project would violate the designation of the Catskill
      Forest Preserve as Status 1 land by the Federal government, a
      protection which explicitly bars development

3.  The project would severely impact traffic on New York State Route
      214, wreaking economic havoc on the affected hamlets, towns, and
      counties.

4.  Key players were not notified beforehand, as legally required.

5.  The topography of the land would make rerouting or replacing New
      York State Route 214 impossible,

6.  New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection operates the
      city’s drinking water supply under a Filtration Avoidance
      Determination (FAD) issued by the US Environmental Protection
      Administration.

7.  As proposed, PEH’s project is not a closed loop system

8.  With so much private property located within close proximity to the
      Stony Clove creek, and surrounded by the Catskill Forest Preserve,
      relocation of homes and businesses along the creek is impossible
      without amendment of the New York State Constitution.

<b>Comments of Chichester Property Owners Association under P-15056.</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>We are members of the Chichester Property Owners Association, a
community organization of three dozen households located in the hamlet
of Chichester, Town of Shandaken, Ulster County, in New York State. Our
FERC ID is #F648342.

We are opposed to the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy
Holdings (PEH) for the project to build a pumped storage hydroelectric
plant utilizing the Ashokan Reservoir (docket number P-15056).

We believe PEH’s proposal is filled with erroneous and misleading
information, and oppose it for the following reasons:

1.  The entire proposed project lies within the Catskill Forest
      Preserve, which has been protected in section 2.1 of the New York
      State Constitution since 1894.

2.  Key players were not notified beforehand, as legally required,
      including:

    a.  New York City

    b.  The hamlets of Lanesville, Chichester, Phoenicia, Mt. Tremper

    c.  Towns of Shandaken, Olive and Hunter

    d.  Ulster and Greene counties

    e.  Hunter Mountain Ski Resort, and its parent company Vail Resorts

3.  Local and vacationer traffic on New York State Route 214, connecting
      Hunter Mountain, and the hamlets of Tannersville and Hunter to all
      points south, would be severely disrupted, wreaking economic havoc
      on the affected hamlets, towns, and counties.

4.  Replacing New York State Route 214 will prove impractical, if not
      impossible, given the topography of the land.

5.  New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection operates the
      city’s drinking water supply under a Filtration Avoidance
      Determination (FAD) issued by the US Environmental Protection
      Administration.

6.  As proposed, PEH’s project is not a closed loop system

7.  With so much private property located within close proximity to the
      Stony Clove creek, and surrounded by the Catskill Forest Preserve,
      relocation of homes and businesses along the creek is impossible
      without amendment of the New York State Constitution.

We urge the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deny Premium Energy
Holdings the permit.

community organization of three dozen households located in the hamlet
of Chichester, Town of Shandaken, Ulster County, in New York State. Our
FERC ID is #F648342.

We are opposed to the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy
Holdings (PEH) for the project to build a pumped storage hydroelectric
plant utilizing the Ashokan Reservoir (docket number P-15056).

We believe PEH’s proposal is filled with erroneous and misleading
information, and oppose it for the following reasons:

1.  The entire proposed project lies within the Catskill Forest
      Preserve, which has been protected in section 2.1 of the New York
      State Constitution since 1894.

2.  Key players were not notified beforehand, as legally required,
      including:

    a.  New York City

    b.  The hamlets of Lanesville, Chichester, Phoenicia, Mt. Tremper

    c.  Towns of Shandaken, Olive and Hunter

    d.  Ulster and Greene counties

    e.  Hunter Mountain Ski Resort, and its parent company Vail Resorts

3.  Local and vacationer traffic on New York State Route 214, connecting
      Hunter Mountain, and the hamlets of Tannersville and Hunter to all
      points south, would be severely disrupted, wreaking economic havoc
      on the affected hamlets, towns, and counties.

4.  Replacing New York State Route 214 will prove impractical, if not
      impossible, given the topography of the land.

5.  New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection operates the
      city’s drinking water supply under a Filtration Avoidance
      Determination (FAD) issued by the US Environmental Protection
      Administration.

6.  As proposed, PEH’s project is not a closed loop system

7.  With so much private property located within close proximity to the
      Stony Clove creek, and surrounded by the Catskill Forest Preserve,
      relocation of homes and businesses along the creek is impossible
      without amendment of the New York State Constitution.

We urge the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deny Premium Energy
Holdings the permit.

1.  The entire proposed project lies within the Catskill Forest

2.  The proposed project would violate the designation of the Catskill

3.  The project would severely impact traffic on New York State Route
      214, wreaking economic havoc on the affected hamlets, towns, and
      counties.

4.  Key players were not notified beforehand, as legally required.

5.  The topography of the land would make rerouting or replacing New

On behalf of Northern Catskills Audubon Society, the 350-member chapter
of the National Audubon Society, and whose chapter territory includes
the area of this proposal, I offer these comments in opposition to the
proposed Ashokan Pumped Energy Storage Project, Docket P-15056.

The proposed project is located within the Catskill Peaks Important Bird
Area (IBA), identified by Audubon New York as one of the largest
contiguous forest tracts in the state. The area was given IBA
designation due to the presence of high-elevation breeding bird species,
such as Bicknell’s Thrush and Blackpoll Warbler, as well as home to the
suite of lower-elevation forest nesting birds. Many of these are
considered species of Special Concern or Threatened in New York State,
or Species of Greatest Conservation Need and include American Black
Duck, Osprey, Bald Eagle, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper’s Hawk, Northern
Goshawk, Red-shouldered Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, American Woodcock,
Olive-sided Flycatcher, Wood Thrush, Scarlet Tanager, Cerulean Warbler,
Black-throated Blue Warbler, and Canada Warbler. In addition to state
protections, Bald Eagle is afforded federal protection under the Bald
and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Ashokan Reservoir, as part of the
IBA, is an important site for wintering waterfowl and it is unknown how
water depth fluctuations from this project would affect those birds.

Permanent protection of this IBA is of utmost importance to protecting
the aforementioned species. This project, if approved, would fragment
the forest to the detriment of those species, as well as species
currently not identified as in need of protections.

We urge FERC to stop this project before much time and money are
needlessly spent, given that further, detailed negative environmental
effects that will certainly be identified in an EIS if the project is
approved to move to the next step.

Sincerely,

Larry Federman

RE: MOTION TO INTERVENE ON PROJECT # 15056-000, ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE
PROJECT

Dear FERC,

I am filing a motion to intervene for proposed project #15056, Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project. I co-own 9.1 acres of property at 624 Woodland
Valley Rd (24.8.1.11), and am a member of Woodland Valley Woods, LLC, 20
acres in size, and Woodland Valley Farm, LLC, approximately 105 acres in
size, which would be inundated by the proposed reservoir in Woodland
Valley associated with the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Our family has owned and lived on this property since 1835, making me a
seventh-generation owner of land that would have to be taken away by
imminent domain to be buried forever under water. The property includes
a homestead constructed in 1865 following the conclusion of the Civil
War and an original barn built in that era. We have a gravesite on the
property, and numerous family heirlooms from generations of family who
were born on, who served the military during the Civil War, the First
World War and World War II, who worked, and who died on this property.
Our family has invested significant time in collaboration with NYC DEP
to serve as good stewards of the property in its important role in
contributing clean drinking water downstream to New York residents,
including the sale of a 97-acre conservation easement to NYC DEP in 2014
that sacrificed our right to further subdivide and develop much of the
property in perpetuity to help ensure watershed protection. We adopted a
Forest Management Stewardship plan through NYC DEP in 2014 and entered
the Woodland Valley Woods, LLC property into the National Tree Farm
System to ensure best management practices and long-term sustainable
management ensures water quality, wildlife and timber conservation for
future generations. Our family is involved in important American
Chestnut restoration with the New York Chapter of the American Chestnut
Society on the property. I, as well as my family, would therefore be
impacted financially, physically, and on a very real level, spiritually,
from the proposed project #15056.

Not only is this property invaluable to me and my family, the proposed
reservoir construction and operation would generate unacceptable risk to
New York City DEP’s unfiltered water supply downstream in the Ashokan
Reservoir via numerous short-term and long-term impacts. The property
currently serves an important role in maintaining the unfiltered water
supply for New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC
DEP) via its contribution to the high- water quality currently found in
Woodland Valley Creek, its floodplains, and several tributaries and
wetlands located on the property. The proposed reservoir and pumped
storage operation would literally destroy all of these important
hydrological resources. Construction of the reservoir dam, associated
blasting for the dam and connecting underground tunnel, land clearing
and clearcutting to remove standing vegetation beneath the reservoir
pool, and roadbuilding to replace many miles of Woodland Valley Road
would all cause significant fine sediment, turbidity and water quality
impacts to Woodland Creek, Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir for
many years. But the major water quality impacts would not be limited to
the 5 or more years of construction and disturbance: the daily
fluctuation of the proposed Woodland Valley Reservoir to serve the
pumped storage needs would erode and resuspend fine sediment and
colloidal clay found in numerous naturally-occurring glacial lacustrine
clay deposits throughout the stream, floodplain and valley. The
underlying geology therefore would contribute turbidity to Esopus Creek
and the Ashokan reservoir potentially on a daily basis, causing great
impact and unacceptable risk to New York City’s drinking water supply to
over 9 million people.

The Woodland Creek serves as an important and valued recreational
resource in its current state for me and my family as well. The Woodland
Creek is a storied wild trout fishery, and provides very significant
spawning and rearing habitat for wild brook, brown and rainbow trout
which migrate annually from the Ashokan Reservoir and the Esopus Creek
to use these fertile headwaters to spawn. The proposed reservoir would
eliminate the current fishery within more than 3 miles of Woodland
Creek, it would forever sever the vital connection of more than 13 miles
of coldwater habitat used by trout in the Esopus Creek/Ashokan Reservoir
causing significant impact to this recreationally valuable fishery. If
the proposed project is permitted to be constructed, it would also
degrade the Esopus Creek fishery downstream from altered water
temperature, sediment regime and water quality impacts from the proposed
reservoir construction and operation. Due to the potential negative
effects of the proposed pumped storage reservoir on the Woodland Creek,
Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir and their cherished wild trout
fishery, I am filing as an intervenor as well.

RE: MOTION TO INTERVENE ON PROJECT # 15056-000, ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE
PROJECT

Dear FERC,

I am filing a motion to intervene for proposed project #15056, Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project. I co-own 9.1 acres of property at 624 Woodland
Valley Rd (24.8.1.11), and am a member of Woodland Valley Woods, LLC, 20
acres in size, and Woodland Valley Farm, LLC, approximately 105 acres in
size, which would be inundated by the proposed reservoir in Woodland
Valley associated with the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Our family has owned and lived on this property since 1835, making me a
seventh-generation owner of land that would have to be taken away by
imminent domain to be buried forever under water. The property includes
a homestead constructed in 1865 following the conclusion of the Civil
War and an original barn built in that era. We have a gravesite on the
property, and numerous family heirlooms from generations of family who
were born on, who served the military during the Civil War, the First
World War and World War II, who worked, and who died on this property.
Our family has invested significant time in collaboration with NYC DEP
to serve as good stewards of the property in its important role in
contributing clean drinking water downstream to New York residents,
including the sale of a 97-acre conservation easement to NYC DEP in 2014
that sacrificed our right to further subdivide and develop much of the
property in perpetuity to help ensure watershed protection. We adopted a
Forest Management Stewardship plan through NYC DEP in 2014 and entered
the Woodland Valley Woods, LLC property into the National Tree Farm
System to ensure best management practices and long-term sustainable
management ensures water quality, wildlife and timber conservation for
future generations. Our family is involved in important American
Chestnut restoration with the New York Chapter of the American Chestnut
Society on the property. I, as well as my family, would therefore be
impacted financially, physically, and on a very real level, spiritually,
from the proposed project #15056.

Not only is this property invaluable to me and my family, the proposed
reservoir construction and operation would generate unacceptable risk to
New York City DEP’s unfiltered water supply downstream in the Ashokan
Reservoir via numerous short-term and long-term impacts. The property
currently serves an important role in maintaining the unfiltered water
supply for New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC
DEP) via its contribution to the high- water quality currently found in
Woodland Valley Creek, its floodplains, and several tributaries and
wetlands located on the property. The proposed reservoir and pumped
storage operation would literally destroy all of these important
hydrological resources. Construction of the reservoir dam, associated
blasting for the dam and connecting underground tunnel, land clearing
and clearcutting to remove standing vegetation beneath the reservoir
pool, and roadbuilding to replace many miles of Woodland Valley Road
would all cause significant fine sediment, turbidity and water quality
impacts to Woodland Creek, Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir for
many years. But the major water quality impacts would not be limited to
the 5 or more years of construction and disturbance: the daily
fluctuation of the proposed Woodland Valley Reservoir to serve the
pumped storage needs would erode and resuspend fine sediment and
colloidal clay found in numerous naturally-occurring glacial lacustrine
clay deposits throughout the stream, floodplain and valley. The
underlying geology therefore would contribute turbidity to Esopus Creek
and the Ashokan reservoir potentially on a daily basis, causing great
impact and unacceptable risk to New York City’s drinking water supply to
over 9 million people.

The Woodland Creek serves as an important and valued recreational
resource in its current state for me and my family as well. The Woodland
Creek is a storied wild trout fishery, and provides very significant
spawning and rearing habitat for wild brook, brown and rainbow trout
which migrate annually from the Ashokan Reservoir and the Esopus Creek
to use these fertile headwaters to spawn. The proposed reservoir would
eliminate the current fishery within more than 3 miles of Woodland
Creek, it would forever sever the vital connection of more than 13 miles
of coldwater habitat used by trout in the Esopus Creek/Ashokan Reservoir
causing significant impact to this recreationally valuable fishery. If
the proposed project is permitted to be constructed, it would also
degrade the Esopus Creek fishery downstream from altered water
temperature, sediment regime and water quality impacts from the proposed
reservoir construction and operation. Due to the potential negative
effects of the proposed pumped storage reservoir on the Woodland Creek,
Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir and their cherished wild trout
fishery, I am filing as an intervenor as well.

On behalf of Northern Catskills Audubon Society, the 350-member chapter
of the National Audubon Society, and whose chapter territory includes
the area of this proposal, I offer these comments in opposition to the
proposed Ashokan Pumped Energy Storage Project, Docket P-15056.

The proposed project is located within the Catskill Peaks Important Bird
Area (IBA), identified by Audubon New York as one of the largest
contiguous forest tracts in the state. The area was given IBA
designation due to the presence of high-elevation breeding bird species,
such as Bicknell’s Thrush and Blackpoll Warbler, as well as home to the
suite of lower-elevation forest nesting birds. Many of these are
considered species of Special Concern or Threatened in New York State,
or Species of Greatest Conservation Need and include American Black
Duck, Osprey, Bald Eagle, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper’s Hawk, Northern
Goshawk, Red-shouldered Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, American Woodcock,
Olive-sided Flycatcher, Wood Thrush, Scarlet Tanager, Cerulean Warbler,
Black-throated Blue Warbler, and Canada Warbler. In addition to state
protections, Bald Eagle is afforded federal protection under the Bald
and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Ashokan Reservoir, as part of the
IBA, is an important site for wintering waterfowl and it is unknown how
water depth fluctuations from this project would affect those birds.

Permanent protection of this IBA is of utmost importance to protecting
the aforementioned species. This project, if approved, would fragment
the forest to the detriment of those species, as well as species
currently not identified as in need of protections.

We urge FERC to stop this project before much time and money are

pumped storage needs would erode and resuspend fine sediment and
colloidal clay found in numerous naturally-occurring glacial lacustrine
clay deposits throughout the stream, floodplain and valley. The
underlying geology therefore would contribute turbidity to Esopus Creek
and the Ashokan reservoir potentially on a daily basis, causing great
impact and unacceptable risk to New York City’s drinking water supply to
over 9 million people.

The Woodland Creek serves as an important and valued recreational
resource in its current state for me and my family as well. The Woodland
Creek is a storied wild trout fishery, and provides very significant
spawning and rearing habitat for wild brook, brown and rainbow trout
which migrate annually from the Ashokan Reservoir and the Esopus Creek
to use these fertile headwaters to spawn. The proposed reservoir would
eliminate the current fishery within more than 3 miles of Woodland
Creek, it would forever sever the vital connection of more than 13 miles
of coldwater habitat used by trout in the Esopus Creek/Ashokan Reservoir
causing significant impact to this recreationally valuable fishery. If
the proposed project is permitted to be constructed, it would also
degrade the Esopus Creek fishery downstream from altered water
temperature, sediment regime and water quality impacts from the proposed
reservoir construction and operation. Due to the potential negative
effects of the proposed pumped storage reservoir on the Woodland Creek,
Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir and their cherished wild trout
fishery, I am filing as an intervenor as well.

brook are pure; all between is contaminated more or less by the work of
man. An ideal trout brook was this, now hurrying, now loitering, now
deepening around a great boulder, now gliding evenly over a pavement of

white and sparkling as snow-water, and nearly as cool. Indeed, the water
of all this Catskill region is the best in the world. For the first few
days, one feels as if he could almost live on the water alone.; he
cannot drink enough of it. In this particular it is indeed the good
bible land, “a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that
spring out of valleys and hills.”

The brook is the particular reason many of the valley’s homeowners chose
to live there. And when it comes their time to die, rather than be
consigned to a cemetery, their emotional attachment is such that they
prefer to have their ashes joined with the brook.

I make no apology for waxing poetic about my boyhood stream. It would be
a sin, a travesty, to permit an energy company to decimate Woodland
Brook. What follows will give you a further idea of how I feel on the
subject.

Thank you.

WOODLAND BROOK

Thoughts of the brook consume me.

There’s early spring, when the water runs

Fast and blue and the shadblow blooms pure white

All along the valley corridor.

My father directs me to use a quill Gordon.

Iron Fraudator hatches while the last

Thin snow falls.

Grandpa was right.

Life is not all skittles and beer.

Even on a bright Memorial Day,

You can find evidence of Winter’s

Harsh directive.

The stench of rotting flesh hits us

Like a wall, as we crash through

Sinewy brush, lugging heavy buckets

Of stocking trout.

The doe’s body was hidden in deep water,

Until this sudden dry spell.

Lately she has become the uncontested property,

Of recalcitrant valley dogs and buzzflies.

In summer the brook dwindles to a crystalline trickle,

Under a demanding sun, grasshoppers bask

In the hot dust and fiddle beneath the black-eyed suzies.

Cautious trout maintain themselves in the shade

Of willows and smooth children’s jumping rocks

They wait for nighttime when they will fill with

Brash courage and feed in a frenzy on top.

Take your rod and visit them then.

To Hell with the cocktail hour.

Cold wet autumn, when the slate drakes hatch

Leaving their skinhusks behind like gossamer souvenirs of their

First life. As May flies, they flutter off through the rain

To begin their brief climactic last-life.

There is the Grandparent’s pool,

Where we laid my parents’ ashes,

First his in his year of death, then her’s.

Angler’s ashes in the waters they loved.

The brook holds them and venerates them,

As do we.

NATHAN DERSHOWITZ

Basis for Intervening:
NATHAN DERSHOWITZ seeks to intervene in this proceeding. He is a
landowner in Woodland Valley and if the Woodland Valley site is chosen,
he will no longer have access to his property. Accordingly, Nathan
Dershowitz has a substantial interest in this matter. No other party
represents Nathan Dershowitz, and no other party is authorized to
represent Mr. Dershowitz’s unique interests. For the foregoing reasons,
Mr. Dershowitz respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Merits objection.

As I understand the Preliminary Permit application, a private party,
Premium Energy Holding, seeks to secure the federal eminent domain power
to potentially flood a large section of Woodland Valley. The claimed
purpose is to store water to supplement energy needs. The proposal does
not make clear who would own the condemned property. More importantly,
it is unclear as to whether there will be any public benefit from this
project. The proponent is a for-profit entity and will presumably sell
the energy to the city, state or federal Government. Thus, this proposal
is not a standard creation of a reservoir, for a public use or the
public good. It is a private entities effort to make money. The project
will not create additional energy, but by arbitrage, the private company
will make money and may or may not make energy minimally cheaper for the
public. Even if sold at a cheap price the economic benefit to the public
seems disproportionately low, compared to the cost and public harm of
this project. This and other legitimate objections have and will be
raised throughout these proceedings by me and others.

I write now to raise additional constitutional objections. First,
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states ‘nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’ By its
terms, the Fifth Amendment does not authorize the taking of state land
by eminent domain. Here, the New York State Constitution Article XIV
makes certain State land forever wild. The State Constitution requires
that certain state land shall not be taken by any corporation, public or
private. To circumvent this provision is a long and timely process,
which very rarely is successful. Some State land in Woodland Valley
would be flooded by this project. The Tenth Amendment provides “[t]he
powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.” The issue of whether, even if prior Supreme Court
decisions would allow Federal eminent domain to be used over the
objection of a state for the confiscation of state land, the present
proposal is extremely suspect as a basis for exercising eminent domain
over State land now being used for the public good. The “public use”
requirement of the Fifth Amendment is hard to justify here and the State
Constitutional establishment of the public good of keeping the property
forever wild cannot be ignored. There are serious questions as to
whether the present Supreme Court of the United States would allow this
project to proceed by use of eminent domain. The present composition of
the Court will, I believe, view the Tenth Amendment as being more
significant as applied to the facts of this situation, than prior courts
did in clearer “public use” cases and will defer to the State
Constitutional assertion of the benefit of forever wild land use.

Similarly, using or delegating eminent domain to and for a private party
for the private party’s personal profit—when the actual benefit to the
public is so speculative—raises other constitutional issues. The public
use or benefit does not flow here from the creation of the reservoir. If
there is any public benefit it would come from the private party selling
its energy. Whether that would be a public benefit would depend on what
the parties negotiate in the future. That is too speculative and
variable a bases for asserting a public benefit. The Supreme Court’s
five-to-four decision in _Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S.469(2005)_
will, in my view, not be extended by the present members of the Court
for a private-to-private transfer in the present situation. Even if the
flooded property is thereafter owned by the Federal or State Government,
herein a private purpose is afoot. Justice Stevens expressly noted for
the majority that “a one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside
the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this
case. While such an unusual exercise of government power would certainly
raise a suspicion that a private purpose was afoot, the hypothetical
cases posited by petitioners can be confronted if and when they arise.”
The present situation seems to present that open question. Private
property will be taken to allow another private party to make a profit
and the hoped for increase in cheap energy will be in the hands of the
second private party. Equally importantly, the four-member dissent in
_Kelo_ seems to reflect the view of the present majority of the Supreme
Court, more than does the majority opinion in _Kelo_.

My view is that the FERC should evaluate these constitutional issues
before an expensive and extensive expenditure of time and money is
wasted on a project with speculative public benefit and clearly
articulated Constitutional declared harm to public area used extensively
for the public good. Pumped storage hydro plants appear to be an
important part of our goal to use renewable energy. But the present
proposal presents a very bad set of facts upon which to proceed.</pre>The above text is a conversion and thus may not be formatted correctly. To read the file in it's original form

NATHAN DERSHOWITZ

Basis for Intervening:
NATHAN DERSHOWITZ seeks to intervene in this proceeding. He is a
landowner in Woodland Valley and if the Woodland Valley site is chosen,
he will no longer have access to his property. Accordingly, Nathan
Dershowitz has a substantial interest in this matter. No other party
represents Nathan Dershowitz, and no other party is authorized to
represent Mr. Dershowitz’s unique interests. For the foregoing reasons,
Mr. Dershowitz respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Merits objection.

As I understand the Preliminary Permit application, a private party,
Premium Energy Holding, seeks to secure the federal eminent domain power
to potentially flood a large section of Woodland Valley. The claimed
purpose is to store water to supplement energy needs. The proposal does
not make clear who would own the condemned property. More importantly,
it is unclear as to whether there will be any public benefit from this
project. The proponent is a for-profit entity and will presumably sell
the energy to the city, state or federal Government. Thus, this proposal
is not a standard creation of a reservoir, for a public use or the
public good. It is a private entities effort to make money. The project
will not create additional energy, but by arbitrage, the private company
will make money and may or may not make energy minimally cheaper for the
public. Even if sold at a cheap price the economic benefit to the public
seems disproportionately low, compared to the cost and public harm of
this project. This and other legitimate objections have and will be
raised throughout these proceedings by me and others.

I write now to raise additional constitutional objections. First,
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states ‘nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’ By its
terms, the Fifth Amendment does not authorize the taking of state land
by eminent domain. Here, the New York State Constitution Article XIV
makes certain State land forever wild. The State Constitution requires
that certain state land shall not be taken by any corporation, public or
private. To circumvent this provision is a long and timely process,
which very rarely is successful. Some State land in Woodland Valley

powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.” The issue of whether, even if prior Supreme Court
decisions would allow Federal eminent domain to be used over the
objection of a state for the confiscation of state land, the present
proposal is extremely suspect as a basis for exercising eminent domain
over State land now being used for the public good. The “public use”
requirement of the Fifth Amendment is hard to justify here and the State
Constitutional establishment of the public good of keeping the property
forever wild cannot be ignored. There are serious questions as to

for a private-to-private transfer in the present situation. Even if the

herein a private purpose is afoot. Justice Stevens expressly noted for

NOTICE OF PRELIMINARY PERMIT APPLICATION ACCEPTED FOR FILING AND
SOLICITING COMMENTS, MOTIONS TO INTERVENE, AND COMPETING APPLICATIONS

(February 11, 2020)

On November 19, 2020, Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, filed an application
for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Federal Power
Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project to be located 14 miles west of the City of Kingston in
Ulster County, New York. The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if
issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license
application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not
authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or
otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners’
express permission.

The proposed project would consist of the following: (1) a new
2,618-foot-long, 212-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 1 (Stony Clove Reservoir) with a surface
area of 245 acres and a storage capacity 22,496 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,500 feet above mean sea level (msl); (2) a new
2,736-foot-long, 232-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 2 (Woodland Reservoir) with a surface
area of 313 acres and a storage capacity 26,231 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,210 feet msl; (3) a new 2,527-foot-long, 304-foot-high
roller-compacted concrete dam for the upper reservoir for alternative 3
(Wittenberg Reservoir) with a surface area of 226 acres and a storage
capacity 25,558 acre-feet at a surface elevation of 1,180 feet msl; (4)
the existing Ashokan Reservoir for the lower reservoir with a surface
area of 8,300 acres and a storage capacity of 382,358 acre-feet at a
surface elevation of 585 feet msl; (5) new 13.99-mile-long tunnels,
shafts, and penstocks for alternative 1 connecting the upper and lower
reservoirs; (6) new 11.58-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for
alternative 2 connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (7) new
3.81-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for alternative 3
connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (8) a new 500-foot-long,
125-foot-wide, 150-foot-high underground reinforced-concrete powerhouse
containing five turbine-generator units with a total rated capacity of
800 megawatts; (9) a 17.3-mile-long, 230-kilovolt new transmission line
for alternatives 1 and 2 from the proposed Ashokan switchyard to the
existing Hurley avenue substation; (10) a 12.9-mile-long, 230-kilovolt
new transmission line for alternative 3 from the proposed Ashokan
switchyard to the existing Hurley avenue substation; and (11)
appurtenant facilities. The proposed project would have a maximum annual
generation of 2,700 gigawatt-hours.

application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not
authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or
otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners’
express permission.

The proposed project would consist of the following: (1) a new
2,618-foot-long, 212-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 1 (Stony Clove Reservoir) with a surface
area of 245 acres and a storage capacity 22,496 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,500 feet above mean sea level (msl); (2) a new
2,736-foot-long, 232-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 2 (Woodland Reservoir) with a surface
area of 313 acres and a storage capacity 26,231 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,210 feet msl; (3) a new 2,527-foot-long, 304-foot-high
roller-compacted concrete dam for the upper reservoir for alternative 3
(Wittenberg Reservoir) with a surface area of 226 acres and a storage
capacity 25,558 acre-feet at a surface elevation of 1,180 feet msl; (4)
the existing Ashokan Reservoir for the lower reservoir with a surface
area of 8,300 acres and a storage capacity of 382,358 acre-feet at a
surface elevation of 585 feet msl; (5) new 13.99-mile-long tunnels,
shafts, and penstocks for alternative 1 connecting the upper and lower
reservoirs; (6) new 11.58-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for
alternative 2 connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (7) new
3.81-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for alternative 3
connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (8) a new 500-foot-long,
125-foot-wide, 150-foot-high underground reinforced-concrete powerhouse
containing five turbine-generator units with a total rated capacity of
800 megawatts; (9) a 17.3-mile-long, 230-kilovolt new transmission line
for alternatives 1 and 2 from the proposed Ashokan switchyard to the
existing Hurley avenue substation; (10) a 12.9-mile-long, 230-kilovolt
new transmission line for alternative 3 from the proposed Ashokan
switchyard to the existing Hurley avenue substation; and (11)
appurtenant facilities. The proposed project would have a maximum annual
generation of 2,700 gigawatt-hours.
