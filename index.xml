This site is meant to serve as a place for resources and news pertaining to Premium Energy Holding’s proposal for a pumped-storage hydroelectric facility in the Catskill Forest Preserve. I created it to aid community members and facilitate their research for comments on the proposal. The information on this site was initially guided by journalist Ginger Strand’s presentation during a Town of Olive Board meeting.</description></item></channel></rss>
